## Here are the following rules and guide lines: 
- Quick project while learning matlab, please not the programming paradigms in this code are not indicative of my current coding style. This code is rather disorganised

- Aim of the game is to connect four in a row

- tiles can be connected in any combinations, up, across or diagonal 

- 1 is denoted by the computer

- 2 is denoted by the user

- computer starts first

- input must be between number 1-7. Failing to input a number between these values will result in an error, and your turn will be skipped.
